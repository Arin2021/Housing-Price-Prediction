# California Housing Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates linear regression on the California housing dataset using scikit-learn. The script loads the dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, creates a linear regression model, trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates its performance. It also includes a plot to visualize the actual and predicted values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries if you don't have them already:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
